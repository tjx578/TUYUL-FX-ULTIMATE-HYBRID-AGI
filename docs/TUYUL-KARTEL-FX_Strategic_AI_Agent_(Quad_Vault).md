## 1. Mission & Scope
- Purpose of the TUYUL-KARTEL-FX Strategic AI Agent.
- Supported asset classes and trading mandates.
- Out-of-scope activities and guardrails.

## 2. System Architecture
- High-level topology linking Quad Vaults, Fusion/Reflective layers, and gateway services.
- Data flow diagram placeholders for ingestion → cognition → execution → feedback.
- Trust boundaries and identity/secret management touchpoints.

## 3. Core Capabilities
- Reasoning and decision engines (Fusion Spectre, Reflective Consciousness, Meta-Learning).
- Risk controls, TII integrity hooks, and auditability features.
- Adaptation mechanisms for market regime shifts.

## 4. Data Sources & Knowledge Inputs
- Market data feeds (prices, volume, order flow).
- Fundamental/news pipelines and scheduled refresh cadence.
- Vault knowledge artifacts and synchronization rules.

## 5. Operational Workflows
- Start-up/bootstrap sequence for coordinated services.
- Trading lifecycle: signal generation → plan approval → execution → post-trade review.
- Feedback loops: REE, TII feedback adapter, and Quad Vault updates.

## 6. Interfaces
- External APIs (FastAPI endpoints, authentication, rate limits).
- Internal service contracts between cognitive, fusion, and reflective layers.
- Observability endpoints/log channels for operators.

## 7. Deployment & Environments
- Target platforms (Cloud Run, container orchestration assumptions).
- Environment matrix (dev/stage/prod) and config management expectations.
- Rollout/rollback strategy and release promotion checklist.

## 8. Monitoring, Alerts, and SLOs
- Key health indicators and telemetry signals.
- Alert thresholds for risk breaches, data drift, and integrity degradation.
- Runbook pointers for common incident types.

## 9. Security & Compliance
- Access control model across Vaults and services.
- Data handling standards (PII/PCI exclusions, retention windows).
- Audit logging requirements and periodic review cadence.

## 10. Safety & Guardrails
- Constraints for model outputs and trade execution safety limits.
- Kill-switch procedures and manual override protocols.
- Validation layers before orders reach brokers/exchanges.

## 11. Extensibility & Roadmap
- Plugin/module points for new indicators, vaults, or reasoning routines.
- Experimentation guidelines and A/B validation checkpoints.
- Backlog themes and phased delivery milestones.

## 12. Documentation Map
- Cross-references to core specs (Fusion, Reflective, TII, FTA, Meta-Learning).
- Links to operational runbooks, diagrams, and schema references.
- Glossary and acronym index placeholders.
